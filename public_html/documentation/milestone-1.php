		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
		<p>Purpose: I would like for my website to be a gallery for graphic design and for poetry.</p>
		<p>Audience: The site is designed with a casual audience in mind. My target audience still includes the professional web development community, as well as recruiters.</p>
		<p>Goal: My primary goal for this project is for it to serve as a gallery for my skills in web development. My secondary goal is to promote art.</p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>Name:Gordon Gallegos</p>
		<p>Age: 42</p>
		<p>Profession: Co-Founder of a few businesses: a horticulture business, a sports bar, and other side ventures. He needs someone to help manage his current websites.</p>
		<p>Technology Used: MacBook Pro 2013 (current OS), and an iPhone 6s Plus on a 4g unlimited network</p>
		<p>Behaviors/Attitudes: Having to manage many businesses makes it difficult to waste time.
			He typically wont spend longer than a few minutes looking over possible candidates for a position he needs to fill, but since this isn't a typical position he fills, he'll take a little extra time
			to make sure a candidates a right fit. He's not on social media, really, and doesn't know much about IT, but knows what he's looking for.</p>
		<p>Frustrations/Needs: He hopes to find candidates soon. He's frustrated with websites that have an overly-complex user-interface but appreciates creativity. He's also frustrated with his current system of handling his websites, and knows that he could do better.
			He's really looking for someone for the long run but also needs someone to help promote what's going on right now, as soon as possible. More specifcally, he's looking for someone with previous experience, 2 to 3 years preferably. His
			newer ventures are growing exponentially and needs someone to help promote his brands. He wants to hire within the next few weeks.</p>
		<p>User Story: As a user I need to quickly determine if this candidate is suitable for managing websites, mostly, independently.</p>

		<p>User Story: As a user, I want to navigate a website comfortably and enjoy the content.</p>
