### Milestone 1 Feedback
Very cool direction for your PWP - I'm really looking forward to seeing what you create! Your purpose, audience, goal and Personas are thoughtful and detailed - nice work.

I do think the Personas could be adjusted and a bit more refined, but otherwise what you have here is a good start. Here's some food for thought: 

Persona #1 (Gordon) doesn't really sound like he reflects your primary or secondary audience. He doesn't sound like someone who is active in the IT and Web Development community (your secondary Audience as stated), nor does he sound like someone who would be involved in direct IT hiring decisions for anything perhaps other than the most entry-level of positions - like content updates - since he does not know anything about IT. A more likely scenario for a person like Gordon would probably be that he'd  hire an established web development firm create and manage his online presence at scale, then he'd perhaps have someone, one of his exisiting employees probably, do content updates and social media. A generally low-paid semi-technial "administrative" task actually. Again, probably not your primary audience.

Persona #2 (Keisha) actually sounds like she would be your primary audience, and I think her Persona could use a bit more detail. It sounds like she would be more interested in the poetry and design content and an engaging UI design than just the performance of the site (not that performance is unimportant). What concerns/behaviors/preferences/frustrations might be relevant to her that would shape your content and UI design concepts for the site going forward? What sites and media does she currently visit or follow? What social media does she use? How would you design your site and content around a user like Keisha  to make it really engaging and interesting to a person like her?

Your project is set up correctly, and overall your code looks good but there were a couple of minor technical points. Have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below. You're ready to begin work on Milestone 2a, and I look forward to seeing your design and content ideas take shape!

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (Submitted late, within one day of due date/time).

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Line 3: The `<meta>` tag should go inside the `<head>`.
- Tiny detail: Out-dent the closing `</html>` tag.
- Tiny detail #2: In your .gitignore, line 2 should be: `.DS_Store` (dot is missing)
