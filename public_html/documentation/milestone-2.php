		<p> <strong> Content Strategy: </strong>
		<p> <em> About-Me : Overall, I want my page to be simple. The about me page is going to have my name and a
			text section underneath it. I also want to have my links to Twitter, Github, and LinkedIn easily accessible,
			meaning that they'll be displayed center page along with the rest of the content. There will be a button
			to move you directly to the Projects/Contact panel.</em </p>
		<p><em> Contact : This section will be divided in two with the projects located on top and the contact form at the
				bottom. I want to have an image of the capstone projects splash page, and include information about it. I'll
				most likely leave it to display one project for simplicity and because my other projects are still being thought of
				right now. The contact section will ask for your full name, email, subject, and allow you to send an email to me.
				There will be a button to reset the forms to make them empty. I will also use captcha for verification. At the top of this page
				there will be a button to pull you back to the top of the document or the about me section. </em></p>
		<p><em> Mobile : The difference between desktop and mobile is that the desktop version will allow you to press the
				buttons located on the top and bottom of the pages to redirect to those parts of the page. The Mobile
				version scrolls sideways from left to right, with no endless scrolling. There will be circular identifiers
				to let the user know what section they're on. </em></p>
